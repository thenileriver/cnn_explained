# DSC 106 Final Project: CNN Visualizations

Created by Neil Sharma, Samuel Mai and Eduardo Spiegel

This project aims at making it easier to understand how CNNs work, from the way images are transformed before entering the CNN 
to the way the images are transformed as they go through the CNN, and how these transformations ultimately become a readable prediction.
